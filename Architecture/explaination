# Architecture Overview

This project implements an event-driven serverless data pipeline using AWS.

The architecture follows a decoupled design where:
- S3 acts as both storage and event source
- Lambda functions perform compute
- Each stage is isolated for scalability and fault tolerance

Data flows from Raw → Processing → Aggregation → Promotion using S3 event notifications.
